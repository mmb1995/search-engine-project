# Sample Search Engine README

This repository contains files to run a simple search engine on a local machine. This engine implements the page rank and tf-idf algorithms in order to rank the relevance of different webpages based off a userâ€™s query. This repository also contains custom files that implement data structures used by the search engine such as ChainedHashDictionaries and ArrayHeaps. This repository is based off an old class assignment and is intended to showcase a range of algorithms, data structures, and concepts like hashing and top K sorting.

The search directory contains the main.java file used to run this application. In order to run the file it is necessary to give the DATA_FOLDER_NAME variable the name of the relevant file from the data folder that you want the search engine to use. In addition, the application will run by default at http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. This port can be changed if desired but it is not necessary to do so.
